        ### A key in UF is a element, UF[x] is x's parent.
        ### If UF[x] == x meaning x is the root of its group.
        UF = {}
        
        ### Given an element, find the root of the group to which this element belongs.

            ### If x == UF[x], meaning x is the root of this group.
            ### If x != UF[x], we use the find function again on x's parent UF[x] 
            ### until we find the root and set it as the parent (value) of x in UF.

        ### Given two elements x and y, we know that x and y should be in the same group, 
        ### this means the group that contains x and the group that contains y 
        ### should be merged together if they are currently separate groups.
        ### So we first find the root of x and the root of y using the find function.
        ### We then set the root of y (rootY) as the root of the root of x (rootX).

        for s,e in edges:
